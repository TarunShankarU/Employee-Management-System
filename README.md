# Employee-Management-System
Employee Management System using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf and MySQL database.
The Employee Management System is a backend-driven web application built with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and HTML, designed to streamline employee data management. It allows administrators to perform CRUD operations, such as adding, updating, viewing, and deleting employee records, with secure login functionality using an ID and password. The backend ensures seamless handling of data, while Thymeleaf templates enhance usability with dynamic content rendering and a clean, structured interface. The system also features a dashboard summarizing key organizational metrics like total employees and department statistics.

Search and Filter: Admins can easily search or filter employees by department, role, or other attributes.
Role-Based Access: Secure authentication for different user roles ensures restricted access to sensitive data.
Data Validation: Form validations enforce data accuracy and integrity.
This system simplifies HR workflows, providing a reliable and scalable solution for managing employee records in a secure and efficient manner. Designed for easy deployment on servers like Apache Tomcat, it is suitable for organizations of all sizes.
